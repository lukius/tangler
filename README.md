tangler
=======

#### Introduction
Tangler is a Python-based HTTP proxy that replaces images and text. Actually, these are just
predefined plugins that are applied whenever a suitable resource is found (i.e., images or HTML).
Additional plugins that perform arbitrary operations on data may also be implemented.

#### Requirements  
Tangler was essentially developed for Python 2.7 under Linux. As it is based on Twisted[1],
it requires this framework to be installed.

#### Usage
Just make Python run the tangler.py file from command line. Use -h option to see how to interact with it.
